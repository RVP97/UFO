# UFO

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a responsive website that allowed users to filter the UFO-spotting table based on different criteria such as, state, country, date, shape, and city.

## Results

The following will perform a visual description of how to perform a search and subsequently filter the data. It is quite simple to do so since the user has to go into any input box such as the one that has the placeholder text "Enter Date", input the data, and either click enter o click any other part of the website.

## Summary

- One of the main drawbacks of this website is that even though it provides the ability to filter, it does not support any sorting. It would be helpful for users to sort the data based on certain conditions.
- My recommendation is to greatly improve design. Since everything shares the same color, it is not as easy for elements to stand out as if the colors were carefully picked.
- Another recommendation would be to add functionality that lets users add data entries to the table. This way it would not only use the data from the file but also user-generated one.
